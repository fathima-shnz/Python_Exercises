# Python Exercises

A collection of beginner-friendly Python exercises completed as part of my foundational programming learning. These exercises cover string operations, data structures (list, dictionary, set), control flow, loops, functions, and a mini-project focused on feedback analysis using real-world logic.

These exercises are structured and commented to demonstrate my understanding of core Python concepts, with a focus on problem-solving and writing clean code.
